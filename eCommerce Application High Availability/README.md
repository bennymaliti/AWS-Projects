## High Availability Architecture for e-commerce Application
In this project, I develop an infrastructure for a high-availability architecture for an ecommerce application. The architecture address the limitations of an ecommerce system that is currently having limitations of the system such as frequent downtime, a lack of fault tolerance, inefficient reource utilisation and having a manual recovery process.

## 🚀 Overview
To achieve high-availability architecture, we will utilise a number of AWS services and components
- **Amazon EC2 with Auto Scalling**      
      : Redundancy       => Deploy instances across 3 AZ's to eliminate single points of failure.  
      : Scalability      => Auto Scaling to adjust capacity based on CPU/memory usage. (eg. scale out at 70% CPU)  
      : Cost Efficiency  => Replace manual scaling with dynamic provisioning
- **Application Load Balancer**    
      : Traffic Distribution : Routes HTTP/HTTPS traffic to healthy instances in multiple AZs.  
      : Integration with Auto Scaling : Automatically registers new instances.  
      : SSL Offloading: Reduces compute load on EC2 by handling TLS termination.  
- Amazon RDS (Multi-AZ + Read Replicas)  
      : High Availability: Multi-AZ deployment ensures automatic failover (standy replica in another AZ).  
      : Read Scalability: Read replicas handle product searches / catalog reads, reducing primary DB load.  
- Amazon ElasticCache (Redis)  
      : Caching: Stores session data and product listings (e.g., 1M + SKUs), reducing DB read latency by ~60%  
      : Managed Service: Automated patching and backups.  
- Amazon CloudFront  
      : Global latency Reduction: Caches static assets (images, CSS/JS) at locations closer to the customer.  
      : DDoS Protection: Integrated with AWS Shield Standard.  
- VPC with Public/Private Subnets  
      :
