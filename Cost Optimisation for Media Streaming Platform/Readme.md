## Cost Optimisation and Resource Management for a Media Streaming Platform  
The aim of this project is to analyse at the costs and improve resource management for a media streaming platform hosted on AWS to ensure efficient utilisation of services.    

## üéØ Objective  
- To analyse the current infrastructure.  
- Identify areas for cost reduction.  
- Propose strategies to achieve cost optimisation goals using AWS services such as  
 * Reserved Instances (RI)  
 * Spot Instances (SI)  
 * Serverless Architectures  
 * AWS Lambda  
 * Amazon S3  
 * Amazon CloudFront  
 * Amazon CloudWatch  
The completion of this project helps in gaining hands-on experience with optimising costs and resource management on AWS and helps drive cost efficiencies for organisations
looking to leveraging cloud infrastructure.  

## üöÄOverview  
- To analyse the existing infrastructure of the media streaming platform and identify opportunities for cost optimisation and resource management.  
- The goal is to reduce unnecessary expenses, improve resource utilisation and leverage AWS services effectively.  

###  **Current Infrastructure Analysis**  
- The first step is to analyse the current infrastructure of the media streaming platform and identify areas where costs can be reduced.  
- This analysis involves examining the usage patterns, resource utilisation and identifying any idle or underutilised resources.  
- We will analyse the utilisation of Amazon EC2 instances and identify opportunities to leverage reserved instances for cost savings.  
- Reseved Instances (RI) allow us to commit specific instance types for a designated period, resulting in discounted hourly rates compared to on-demand instances.  
- Spot Instances (SI) can also be considered for workloads that are tolerant of interruptions and require significant compute resources.  
  By utlising Spot Instances, we can take advantage of unused EC2 capacity at significantly lower prices.  

### **Cost-Saving Strategies**  
- Propose cost-saving strategies such as implementing serverless architecture.  
- Analyse storage and content delivery on Amazon S3 that can be utilised for efficient storage of media files, reducing costs compared to traditional storage solutions.  
- Analyse storage requirements, implement lifecycle policies and optimise storage classes to ensure cost-effective storage management.  
- Improve the performance of content delivery by implementing Amazon CloudFront.    

### **Monitoring and Optimisation**  
- Track the usage and performance of AWS resources by utilising Amazon CloudWatch.
